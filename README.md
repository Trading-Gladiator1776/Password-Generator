# Password-Generator
# Python programmed random password generator
Every year for work I have to create new passwords. Any website I want to use often asks me to create an account which of course involves a password. 
I try to create a unique password for each website I visit.
Sometimes that can be more difficult than others. Are you feeling the same way?
Still using qwerty12345 as your password for EVERY site you visit?

Say no more! The PyPassword Generator will help you create a unique password every time you use it.
